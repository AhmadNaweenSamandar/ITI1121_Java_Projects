In my second semester, I will be focusing on Java projects that explore Abstract Data Types (ADTs) such as lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees, as well as core object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These projects will deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, while also enhancing my ability to design and implement robust, scalable, and maintainable software solutions. This repository will serve as a reflection of my progress and understanding of key Java concepts as I apply them to real-world programming challenges. Stay tuned for updates and new additions!
